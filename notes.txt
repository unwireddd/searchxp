TODO for now:

-add a search bar in the results page
-add the images page
-add 2-3 more parsers

The main problem for now is that my parser is too slow, first I need to remove the time sleeps and separate the image search function somehow
next thing is that for now it has to run 2 separate pyton scripts which I believe slows down the entire process, I can try to connect them somehow
