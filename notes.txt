what can I try doing is to move the html file to the dataset folder and execute it from there or something

ok so theoretically if that html file was located in the dataset folder instead it would start working

I may want to fix the multiword search issue in the bing parser and add the country detection before I proceed to writing another scrapper

okay so it seems that parsing google is dead and it doesnt matter which parser I use
